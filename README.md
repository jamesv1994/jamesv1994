# Hey
I am a Professional IT-Specialist and DevOps-Engineer. Specialised in System automation with Ansible,
CI/CD pipelines, Terraform and Python development. I work a lot with Cloud-Environments (mainly AWS) and love to find clever solutions, to tough problems. Though I am not an expert I do find security topics interesting.
